We're a class behind, so we'll do the following from the previous classes: 

* [Middleware](slides/09/middleware.html)
* [Sessions and Cookies](slides/10/sessions.html)

And some new-ish material:

* [Forms Revisited](slides/11/forms-revisited.html)

__Midterm Practice__

* [midterm practice](resources/handouts/midterm/midterm_1_practice.pdf)
* [midterm practice solutions](resources/handouts/midterm/midterm_1_practice_solutions.pdf)

Unlikely that we'll get to this:

* [Project Layout and Scaffolding](slides/11/scaffolding.html)
* [Mongo DB](slides/14/mongo.html)
