## Some Rules

__Lastly... some important things you should remember to do!__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} always end statements with a semicolon 
    * {:.fragment} our static analysis tool is set up to catch missing semicolons
    * {:.fragment} (though there's also the opposite approach to just drop all semicolons)
* {:.fragment} always declare your variables (use <code>var</code>)
* {:.fragment} don't use function declaration in a non-function block (such as an if statement)
