## Object-Oriented Programming


__Describe the following object oriented programming concepts__: &rarr;

* __inheritance__ <span class="fragment">- basing a class off of another class so that it maintains the same behavior as its super class</span>
* __polymorphism__ <span class="fragment">- having the same interface to instances of different types</span>
* __encapsulation__ <span class="fragment">- information hiding, internals/implementation details not accessible publicly</span>
* __abstraction__  <span class="fragment">- (again) creating tools / interfaces that allow a programmer to address the actual problem they're solving rather than having to deal with necessary, but irrelevant (to the problem) details</span>

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

In Java, __what language features / constructs allow inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction?__ &rarr; 

* __inheritance__ - subclassing... using extend
* __polymorphism__ - instances of different classes that are subclasses of the same superclass
* __encapsulation__ - private methods and private members variables
* __abstraction__ - creating classes, interfaces, abstract classes, and methods

## _Object-Oriented Programming_ in JavaScript

Although JavaScript _has_ objects, its approach to _object-oriented programming_ is a bit unconventional. 

* it still supports __encapsulation__, __inheritance__, __polymorphism__, and __abstraction__ 
* ... but it does so __differently__ than Java (and other languages that support _classical object-oriented_ techniques) &rarr;

<br>

* inheritance - prototypes and/or functions
* polymorphism - _duck typing_
* encapsulation - closures
* abstraction - higher order functions, prototypes, etc.

## An Aside on Duck Typing

### _If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck... it's a duck_

* when an object's methods and properties determine valid semantics
* ... rather than its class or the class that it inherits from

# Let's dive into objects

### (ouch)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Globals

First off, in both Node and browser-based JavaScript implementations a __global object__ exists:

* <code>global</code> for node
* <code>window</code> for browsers

<br>
__Let's see what this looks like by__: &rarr;

* checking out global in the interactive shell
* inadvertently creating a global variable within a function definition (dropping `const`, `let`, and `var`)

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
console.log(global.mistake);
function oopsGlobal() {
	mistake = "yup";
}
oopsGlobal();
console.log(mistake);
console.log(global.mistake);
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Methods

__Methods__ are object properties that are functions (a function within the context of an object).

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
const cat = {};
cat.speak = function() {
	console.log("meow"); 
};
cat.speak();
</code></pre>

Notice that you can attach methods to any arbitrary object instance! (???)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## This

"When a function is called as a method—looked up as a property and immediately called, as in object.method()—the special constiable __<code>this</code>__ in its body will point to the object that it was called on". __What will be printed out in the code below?.__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function speak() {
	if(this.nationality == "Japanese") {
		console.log("nyan");
	} else if (this.nationality == "American") {
		console.log("meow");
	} else {
		console.log("default cat noise");
	}
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
const japaneseCat = {nationality:"Japanese", speak:speak};
const americanCat = {nationality:"American", speak:speak};
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
japaneseCat.speak();
americanCat.speak();
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
nyan
meow

## In methods, <code>this</code> refers to the object that the method was called on

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Hm. What if a Function isn't Attached to an Object?

A standalone function's __<code>this</code>__ refers to the global object. __What will the following code print out?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
global.outside = 5;
const f = function() {
	console.log(this.outside);
}
f();
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>

// this is the global object!

<section markdown="block">
## Standalone Functions and This

__Aaaand... what's the output of our speak function from the previous slide if we call it on its on (not within the context of an object)?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function speak() {
	if(this.nationality == "Japanese") {
		console.log("nyan");
	} else if (this.nationality == "American") {
		console.log("meow");
	} else {
		console.log("default cat noise");
	}
}
speak();
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
default cat noise
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

* if we <code>console.log(this.nationality)</code> ...  we'll see it's <code>undefined</code>
* nationality was not yet defined on the global object, so we get <code>undefined</code>

## Another Way(s)

Besides __method__ invocation and __regular function invocation__, __what are two other ways of executing a function?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} `call` - invoke function that call was called on with specified `this` and positional arguments
* {:.fragment} `apply` - invoke function that apply was called on with specified `this` and an `Array` containing positional arguments

<br>
When invoking a function with __`call` or `apply`__: 
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} __`this` will be bound to the value passed in as the first argument.__
* {:.fragment} __What's the output of the following code?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function greet(person) { console.log(this.greeting, person); }
const obj = { greeting: 'hi' };
greet.call(obj, 'joe');
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
hi joe
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Call and Apply Continued

__Aaaand... of course, call and apply with our cat example (modified a bit). What is the output of this code?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function speak(how, toWho) {
    const d = {Japanese: "nyans", American: "meows"};
    const noise = d[this.nationality] || "default cat noise";
    console.log(noise, how, 'at', toWho);
}
const cat = {nationality: "American"}

speak.apply(cat, ['loudly', 'you']);
speak.apply({}, ['softly', 'me']);
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
meows loudly at you
default cat noise softly at me
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block" data-background="#440000">
## When executing a function with the methods `call` or `apply`, <code>this</code> refers to the object passed in as the first argument to either method
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Another Mystery?

__What is the output of this code and why?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
const counter = {numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4], animal:'owl'};

counter.count = function() {
    this.numbers.forEach(function(n) {
        console.log(n, this.animal + (n > 1 ? 's' : ''));
    });
};
counter.count();
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
1 'undefined'
2 'undefineds'
3 'undefineds'
4 'undefineds'
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

The anonymous function is being invoked as a __regular function__ for every element in the `Array`, `counter.numbers`. __`this` refers to global object__, which does not have the property, `animal`, resulting in `undefined`.
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Arrow Functions

In previous slides, we said that the `this` value in __arrow functions__ is the `this` in the scope that the arrow function was created in (that is, it doesn't have it's _own_ `this`, it just uses the one that's already there!

__Let's see how this works:__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
const counter = {numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4], animal:'owl'};

counter.count = function() {
    this.numbers.forEach((n) => {
        console.log(n, this.animal + (n > 1 ? 's' : ''));
    });
};
counter.count();
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
1 'owl'
2 'owls'
3 'owls'
4 'owls'
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

Better! `this` is whatever `this` refers to in the count method, and because `count` was invoked as a method, `this` is the object that `count` was called on.
{:.fragment}
</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Arrow Functions Continued

Of course, that means if we use the following code, what will `this` refer to? __What is the output of the following code?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function foo() {
    const bar = (x) => { console.log(this.qux); };
    bar();
}
foo();
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
undefined
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

`this` references `this` in the function, `foo`, which was invoked as a regular function. Consequently, `this` is the global object.
{:.fragment}
</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Summary

_What is this?????_

1. {:.fragment} __regular function invocation__ 
    * {:.fragment} `this` is the global object
2. {:.fragment} __method call__
    * {:.fragment} `this` is the object the method was called on
3. {:.fragment} __invoked with call or apply__
    * {:.fragment} `this` is the first argument passed in to call or apply
4. {:.fragment} __arrow function__
    * {:.fragment} `this` is `this` from the enclosing context 

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## A Magic Trick

__Let's try running this code...__ &rarr;

* have we defined any properties on the object called <code>empty</code>?
* will this produce output or give us an error?

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
const empty = {}; 
console.log(empty.toString);
console.log(empty.toString());
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
[Function: toString]
[object Object]
</code></pre>

<section markdown="block">
## Inherited Properties

__If we started off with an empty object in the previous slide, where did the toString method come from?__

* "in addition to their set of properties, almost all objects also have a __prototype__"
* "a __prototype__ is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties"
* "when an object gets a request for a property that it does not have..."
* "its prototype will be searched for the property, then the prototype’s prototype, and so on"
