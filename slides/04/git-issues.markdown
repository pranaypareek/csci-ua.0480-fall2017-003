## Cloning vs init and push

* previous instructions specified to clone
* those instructions were if you _actually_ had stuff in the repository beforehand
* if your remote is empty... use the init and push workflow instead

## Multiple GitHub Accounts

There may be a credential caching issue if you have more than 1 github account.

* I believe you can fix this by changing your global .gitconfig.
* However, a fix that definitely works is to use SSH rather than HTTPS (you'll have to generate a key if you don't already have one... and add to your github settings)
