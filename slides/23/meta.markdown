## Homework #6

* you can use stylesheets
* you don't have to use canvas
* you must call addEventListener on the element that you want to listen for an event (each individual card, the start button, etc.)
* do not write out html using innerHTML, instead create DOM elements
* avoid using globals if possible
* I have office hours today 'til 1pm

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Milestone #1, Final Project

* you can use one of our existing projects (just augment it to fulfill the requirements)
* you can integrate it into another project that you're working on (another class, a personal project, etc.)
* __any other questions?__ &rarr;
