## Homework Homework Homework

__[Homework #3](../../homework/03.html) was posted yesterday, and is due next Tuesday__

* {:.fragment} you should have your repositories with starter files
* {:.fragment} it's fairly different from the previous homeworks, so it'll be more stimulating/challenging (it incorporates material from objects/prototypes, higher order functions, socket programming, and http!)
* {:.fragment} however, the amount of code you write will likely be no more than homework #01

<br>
Speaking of homework 01, grades should be posted by the end of this week.

##  Quizzes

__Quizzes #2 (Oject Basics) and #3 (Objects and Prototypes) are due on Thursday.__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} all about objects but split into two parts, with 17 questions total
* {:.fragment} first set is super easy; 7 questions
* {:.fragment} second set is slightly more challenging because it deals with prototypes; it has 10 questions, with some questions __being very similar but with subtle differences__
* {:.fragment} please inform me of any issues regarding quizzes; one correction was already made (and quizzes regraded accordingly)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Survey Results

[Here are some of the aggregate survey results](../../resources/img/survey.png)

__So, what does this mean?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} I'll adjust the pace of the lectures accordingly
* {:.fragment} but homework is very slightly on the easy side (which seems contradictory to above... though I think homework #03 will be adequately challenging and fun)
* {:.fragment} there some demand for a git tutorial, but not enough to devote an in-class lecture; i will do an out-of-class workshop
* {:.fragment} hm... for tutoring, i'll see what I can do about scheduling after 5pm tutoring hours

## JavaScript From Here on In

__Of course, we'll still be using JavaScript heavily throughout the class.__ 

* But we won't be focusing on the language itself anymore. 
* There are a few things that we didn't have chance to cover:
	* {:.fragment} composition vs inheritance
	* {:.fragment} calling super methods and constructors

<br>
I'll write something up on those topics...

## Before We Go On

A re-cap of questions that I've received a few times...

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## This

During our last class, we went over a few patterns for function invocation.  __Do you remember any of those patterns and how they affected _this_?__

* __method invocation__ (this &rarr; object that method was called on)
* __function invocation__ (this &rarr; global)
* __call, apply__ (this &rarr; whatever we want it to be!)

</section>

## Constructors / Properties

When writing a constructor, we can set properties and values on the instances that are created from it. __How do we do this? (hint... there are two ways)__ &rarr;

* using __this__
* adding to the __prototype__ property
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function MyConstructor() {
	this.prop = 'I\'m a property';
}

MyConstructor.prototype.printSomething = function() {
	console.log('me too');
};

var foo = new MyConstructor();
console.log(foo);
foo.printSomething();
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Constructors / Properties

__Which one do we use?__ &rarr;

From [Mozilla's JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Performance_considerations)...
{:.fragment}

> "methods should normally be associated to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor"
{:.fragment}

As we mentioned before, a function is assigned to every object when using this, but there's only one function for every instance when using prototype.
