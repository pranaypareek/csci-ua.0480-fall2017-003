## JavaScript From Here on In

__Of course, we'll still be using JavaScript heavily throughout the class.__ 

* But we won't be focusing on the language itself anymore. 
* There are a few things that we didn't have chance to cover:
	* {:.fragment} composition vs inheritance
	* {:.fragment} calling super methods and constructors

<br>
I'll write something up on those topics...

## Before We Go On

A re-cap of questions that I've received a few times...

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## This

During our last class, we went over a few patterns for function invocation.  __Do you remember any of those patterns and how they affected _this_?__

* __method invocation__ (this &rarr; object that method was called on)
* __function invocation__ (this &rarr; global)
* __call, apply__ (this &rarr; whatever we want it to be!)

</section>

## Constructors / Properties

When writing a constructor, we can set properties and values on the instances that are created from it. __How do we do this? (hint... there are two ways)__ &rarr;

* using __this__
* adding to the __prototype__ property
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
function MyConstructor() {
	this.prop = 'I\'m a property';
}

MyConstructor.prototype.printSomething = function() {
	console.log('me too');
};

var foo = new MyConstructor();
console.log(foo);
foo.printSomething();
</code></pre>

## Constructors / Properties

__Which one do we use?__ &rarr;

From [Mozilla's JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Performance_considerations)...
{:.fragment}

> "methods should normally be associated to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor"
{:.fragment}

As we mentioned before, a function is assigned to every object when using this, but there's only one function for every instance when using prototype.
