## Write a Simple Number Guessing Game

On the server side:

* your application should have a hardcoded secret number
* and a way of storing a user's guesses

On the frontend:

* you'll have a form that:
	* allows you to submit a guess
	* shows all of the previous guesses
* and a win page that shows the secret number (this is silly)

## Some More Details

Use Post, Redirect, Get (PRG) to implement your form submission process. The URL's you'll have to handle are:

* __GET /__ - the form
* __POST /__ - sending data to the server
* __GET /win__ - the win page
