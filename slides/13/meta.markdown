## Today's Topics

I'll keep today's class fairly open ended, so we can discuss:

* questions about the midterm exam ()
* questions about homework #4 (due yesterday, but???)

Otherwise, I'll reinforce the topics that we went skimmed through last week:

* forms
* sessions

(I've augmented the slides from the previous class based on feedback)

## Homework #02

Nice work!

* __read the comments in the grader feedback!__ 

Some common errors:

* should have implemented your own every and some
* flatten required the use of reduce
* use ===
* use var
* avoid using magic numbers (why use number, when you can use key/name!)
</section>

* watch out for relative vs absolute urls in links
* q's abt objects / prototypes?
* res.render’s second arg - keys are template vars
* redirect to same domain (when to include domain) 
* styling 404
* no weirdo 'shops
