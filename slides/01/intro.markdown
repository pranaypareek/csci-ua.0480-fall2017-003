## Motivation for Technologies

__Why use JavaScript, Node.js and Express over Ruby and Ruby on Rails or Python and Django?__


1. {:.fragment} only __one language to learn__ throughout the course for server side development, front end development... and even database queries
2. {:.fragment} __straightforward to install__ entire stack (node, mongodb) on Windows, Linux and OSX
3. {:.fragment} seems like a __skill set that's currently sought after__ (former students are working with these technologies professionally!)
4. {:.fragment} chosen tools are becoming (if not already) __industry standard__ (__git__, __eslint__, etc.)
5. {:.fragment} a __fun__ stack to learn (really!)

<br> 
The concepts and theory remain roughly the same across this and other _technology stacks_, though...
{:.fragment}

Pros and cons for using this stack will be discussed in future classes.

## Whew - That's a Lot of Stuff!

<section markdown="block">
## Me?

### Joe Versoza

* {:.fragment} I think I know some of you / you know me (uh-oh ... __why__ would you want take another _class_ with me?)!
* {:.fragment} __Clinical Assistant Professor__ (you can find me at: {{ site.office_hours_room }})
* {:.fragment} Before teaching...
	* {:.fragment} part-time adjunct at __NYU__ and __City-Tech__
	* {:.fragment} while working as an IT Manager at non-profit 
    * {:.fragment} (turns out that managing programmers is sometimes _not fun_    &#128557; &#128514; &#128528;) 
    * {:.fragment} also worked as software engineer for a looong time - mostly with &#128013; ([web.py](http://webpy.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and even some [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)), but with some [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [Java/JSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages) too...

<aside class="notes">
Why would you ever take another class with me?
Really love teaching. Left great full time job management/programming job to teach!
FYI, also - for coders - management is difficult, but it's a legit career track
</aside>

<section markdown="block">
## About... You

### Some (non-) expectations:

Only __minimal__ experience with
{:.fragment}

* __JavaScript__ 
* __server-side web development__ 
* _modern_ __front-end development__
{:.fragment}

</section>
<section markdown="block">

## If You Already Know This Stuff

For example...

* {:.fragment} if __you do this professionally__ (seriously, I've had people who get paid to do this take this class???  &#129300;)
* {:.fragment} or... if __you've already taken several web minor courses__, including web programming and databases

<br> 
__What are you doing here? GET OUT!__ &#128073;
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} Really, though, you probably won't get much out of the class 
* {:.fragment} And you'll slack off a bit 
* {:.fragment} <small markdown="block" style="display:inline">(and then get like a B+, and then you'll try to argue with me about your grade, and I'll be like _I told you not to take this class_, and then we'll both be sad. The end.)</small>

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## More About You...

### Additionally, I expect that you would:

1. {:.fragment}  be very __comfortable__ using the __commandline__
2. {:.fragment} have the ability to install tools, software, etc. ... and troubleshoot installations (<strong>basically _know how to use a computer_ </strong>)
3. {:.fragment} be able __navigate__ through your __file system__ (both through a file explorer like Finder and through the commandline)
4. {:.fragment} have basic/rudimentary knowledge of __HTML__ and __CSS__ (even a [late 90's notion](https://www.google.com/search?q=90%27s+website&espv=2&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=wegEVMjPJcPxgwTA5YDICg&ved=0CCgQsAQ&biw=1307&bih=729) of how this stuff works _may be_ fine)
5. {:.fragment} <strong>_actually do homework and - you know - occasionally come to class_</strong> 
6. {:.fragment} low bar, I know... but I mean it

## Workload

__Some salient quotes from evaluations/reviews__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment}"__Gives Lots of homework__ and focuses on too many details at exam. He has some sort of weird smartness that he would like to show off."
* {:.fragment} "Great professor. Gives __a decent amount of homework__, but it's very effective at helping you learn the material." 

<br>
So, regardless of whether or not the review was positive or negative, __the common thread is there's kind of _a lot of work_ involved in this course__ ...
{:.fragment}

__Expect the workload to be on the same level as some your earlier cs courses__ (like Intro to CS, Data Structures) &rarr;
{:.fragment}

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Workload Continued

__Uh, so... how much work is this _really_?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} almost __weekly homework__ (8 total, which is actually less than the number of homeworks for 0002 or 0101) __and a final project__
* {:.fragment} this course is not challenging in the way that something like _algorithms_ is, but it's challenging because of: 
    * {:.fragment} the __wide range of topics__ covered
    * {:.fragment} the __volume of hands-on work__ (again, though, no more than weekly assignments in 101)
    * {:.fragment} the  __difficult nature of debugging__ web applications that involve integrating several technologies
* {:.fragment} a lot of homework will be:
    * write your own library that _does x_
    * use that library to implement some sort of web application
    * use an existing library that already _does x_ to re-write above ^
</section>


<section markdown="block">
## Too Easy/Difficult, Too Much Work?

__Consider choosing a different course if you:__

1. {:.fragment} _are a __professional__ web developer_ or __already know this stuff__
3. {:.fragment} think this may be __more work than you accommodate__ this semester
4. {:.fragment} __not comfortable with the requirements__ (commandline, basic html, css, etc.)
5. {:.fragment} you're a senior and want an easy C to meet your cs major requirements

<br>
__If you want a slower pace and are _truly_ interested in the material, there are some non major courses around as well__
{:.fragment}

* __CSCI-UA.60__ Database Design & Web Implementation
* __CSCI-UA.61__ Web Development & Programming
{:.fragment}

## This is the 4th Run of This Course

* I'm trying to compress the beginning part of the course to make sure I get through all of the topics
* Some common themes throughout the comments from previous versions of this course were:
    * {:.fragment} drawing of a cat (????)
* {:.fragment} All that is to say - I'm catering to a wide variety of skills/backgrounds, so just let me know if you think I'm going to fast or too slow
	* come see me during my [office hours](../../index.html)
	* contact me at __jversoza__ at __cs__ dot __nyu__ dot __edu__

## How to Make No One Happy

Students coming into the course __have very different backgrounds when it comes to web development__ (from _What's a CSS?_ to _You mean this course doesn't go into using Redux?_) &rarr;

* {:.fragment} Sooo... I try to hit the __middle ground__
* {:.fragment} which means, for students with no web development experience, it's a: "__Hard class for me (no previous exp to webdev) but is fair. There should be a prereq to this class not to let people like me take the class.__"
* {:.fragment} and for students with web development experience: "__General pace was good - could have maybe been a little faster.__"
* {:.fragment} just can't make anyone happy  &#128580; ... though one comment was __(a drawing of a cat)__

<br>
(this should probably be two courses, and maybe it will eventually be that...)

<section markdown="block">
## That Sounds Pretty Harsh/Boring

__If you're concerned about the workload and the material...__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} I'm __always available to help__, especially on piazza, but also before and after class, during office hours and by appointment
* {:.fragment} We'll also have a tutor (I'll post a schedule mid-week)

<br>
__If you think it's going too slowly...__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} challenge yourself... for example, if the assignment is to make a simple game
* {:.fragment}  __make your own library/framework__ from scratch (for example, if you use rxjs or immutable.js, try to re-implement parts of it), and use it to write the game
* {:.fragment} or... __add features__ to make the game _more complete_ - like... adding an undo move feature
* {:.fragment} or... add support tooling like unit tests, linters, and other build tools
* {:.fragment} or... or _actually_ deploy it
