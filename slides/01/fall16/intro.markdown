## Soooo... What Class Is This Again?

Just to make sure you're in the right place:

* Special Topics - __{{ site.course_name }}__ 
* _Someone_ started calling it AIT (not me, I have enough acronyms in my life!), and for some reason, that caught on
* Course Number __{{ site.course_number }}__, Section __{{ site.course_section }}__

<aside class="notes">
* hold on, are you in the right place?

## Me?

### Joe Versoza

* {:.fragment} I think I know some of you / you know me (uh-oh ... why would you want take another _class_ with me?)!
* {:.fragment} __Clinical Assistant Professor__ (you can find me at: {{ site.office_hours_room }})
* {:.fragment} Before teaching...
	* part-time adjunct at __NYU__ and __City-Tech__
	* IT Manager at non-profit (wrangling developers / herding cats) 
        <br>
        ![herding cats](http://i.imgur.com/Yj9Xe2A.gif)
* {:.fragment} also worked as software engineer for a looong time mostly with Python ([web.py](http://webpy.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)), but some [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [Java/JSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages), etc.

<aside class="notes">
Why would you ever take another class with me?
Really love teaching. Left great full time job management/programming job to teach!
FYI, also - for coders - management is difficult, but it's a legit career track

<section markdown="block">
## About... You

### Some (non-) expectations:

Only __minimal__ experience with
{:.fragment}

* __JavaScript__ 
* __server-side web development__ 
* _modern_ __front-end development__
{:.fragment}

### If you already know this stuff...
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} like... maybe you do this professionally (seriously, I've had people who get paid to do this take this class???)
* {:.fragment} or... you've already taken several web minor courses, including web programming and databases
* {:.fragment} __what are you doing here? GET OUT!__
* {:.fragment} really, though, you won't get much out of the class
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## More About You...

### Additionally, I expect that you would:

* be very comfortable using the __commandline__
* have the ability to install tools, software, etc. ... and troubleshoot installations (basically _know how to use a computer_)
* be able navigate to navigate your file system
* have basic/rudimentary knowledge of __HTML__ and __CSS__ (even a [late 90's notion](https://www.google.com/search?q=90%27s+website&espv=2&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=wegEVMjPJcPxgwTA5YDICg&ved=0CCgQsAQ&biw=1307&bih=729) of how this stuff works _may be_ fine)
* _actually do homework and come to class_
* low bar, I know...

## Technologies

__If you've been following along, the specific tools, languages and frameworks we'll be using include:__

* [JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) (and Mongoose)
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) (maybe)
* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (or maybe Grunt... or maybe webpack)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* etc.

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Motivation for Technologies

__Why use JavaScript, Node.js and Express over Ruby and Ruby on Rails or Python and Django?__

The concepts and theory remain roughly the same across all of these _technology stacks_, but here's why I chose what I did:

1. {:.fragment} we only need to learn one language throughout the course for server side development, front end development... and even for querying the database
2. {:.fragment} pretty straightforward to install the entire stack (node, mongodb) on Windows, Linux and OSX
3. {:.fragment} seems like there's a lot of opportunity out there (I've had former students contact me to let me know that they're working with node professionally!)
4. {:.fragment} work with tools that are either currently or becoming industry standards (__git__, __jshint__, etc.)
5. {:.fragment} a __fun__ stack to learn (really! ...I'm excited about delving into it too!)
6. {:.fragment} we'll talk about the technical trade-offs for using this stack next week
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Too Easy or Too Difficult?

* __You may consider choosing a different class if you:__
	* _are a professional web developer_? 
	* already know this stuff
	* think this may be too much work 
	* not comfortable with the requirements
* {:.fragment} __(There are some non major courses around as well)__
	* __CSCI-UA.60__ Database Design & Web Implementation
	* __CSCI-UA.61__ Web Development & Programming

## This is the 4th Run of This Course

* I'm trying to compress the beginning part of the course to make sure I get through all of the topics
* Some common themes throughout the comments from previous versions of this course were:
    * {:.fragment} "__Hard class for me (no previous exp to webdev) but is fair. There should be a prereq to this class not to let people like me take the class.__"
    * {:.fragment} "__General pace was good - could have maybe been a little faster.__"
    * {:.fragment} drawing of a cat (????)
* {:.fragment} All that is to say - I'm catering to a wide variety of skills/backgrounds, so just let me know if you think I'm going to fast or too slow
	* come see me during my [office hours](../../index.html)
	* contact me at __jversoza__ at __cs__ dot __nyu__ dot __edu__
    {:.fragment}

<section markdown="block">

	* __JavaScript__
	* __Node / Express__
	* __MongoDB__
	* __Client Side Build-Out__
	* __Client Side Programming__
	* __Frameworks and Libraries__
* {:.fragment} (all this could change based on class progress / existing class experience)
