## Books (JavaScript Specific)

* __required__
	* [{{ site.book_js }}]({{ site.book_js_link }}) &rarr;
		* great JavaScript / intro to programming book (may be too basic for some, though!)
		* the [online version]({{ site.book_js_link }}) is free
	* [{{ site.book_js_2 }}]({{ site.book_js_2_link }}) &rarr;
		* if you've seen JavaScript before / feel like you have this _programming thing_ down, this is for you
		* the [online version]({{ site.book_js_link }}) is also free

## What's JavaScript?

### Perhaps you've used it before!

* __JavaScript__ is a __widely used__, __high-level__ programming language that is __available on many platforms__
* __JavaScript__ and __Java__ are two entirely different programming languages

##  Some History
Originally created in 1995 (by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)) as a way to add interactivity (through programming) to web pages in __Netscape Navigator__!

## More History

* Microsoft also implemented a compatible dialect of JavaScript for Internet Explorer called [JScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript)
* formally standardized in the late 90's (under the name [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript))
	* implementations include the JavaScript engines in various browsers 
	* as well as [ActionScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) (remember Flash?) 
	* and, of course, various server side implementations, such as Node.js and Rhino
* (did I mention that it's __not Java__?)

## Where is it Now?

__It's in transition... (and the naming conventions are confusing)__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} the previous version, ES5, has been implemented fairly __completely__ in all modern browsers
* {:.fragment} ES6 (also called ES2015) is "mostly" [implemented in node and major browsers](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
* {:.fragment} we'll learn ES5 along with some ES6 features 
* {:.fragment} the standard for ES7 (also called ES2016) was finalized in the summer of 2016, but it's features are only partially implemented by browsers
* {:.fragment} (we maaaaay go over ES7 stuff)

## Aaaand, What's it Used For?

__JavaScript is now...__ &rarr;

* _ubiquitous_ on the web
* it's an integral part of creating modern, single-page web apps
* ...but it's usage has gone beyond web page interactivity:
	* {:.fragment} server side language (__Node.js__)
	* {:.fragment} database query language (__MongoDB__)
	* {:.fragment} creative programming (__processing.js__)
	* {:.fragment} embedded scripting language (__Max/MSP__)

## Where You've Seen It

* __as a server side language, JavaScript can be found on:__
	* (as mentioned before) [PayPal](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2013/11/22/node-js-at-paypal/), [New York Times](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/nyt-redesigns-mobile/), and  [LinkedIn](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2567673)
	* [even](http://jobs.netflix.com/jobs.php?id=NFX01209) [NetFlix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/08/scaling-ab-testing-on-netflixcom-with_18.html) and [Walmart](http://codewinds.com/podcast/002.html)!?
	* [and others, of course](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/node-js-becoming-go-technology-enterprise#.VAUUIWSwLPY)
* __here are some particularly _awesome_ uses of JavaScript on the front-end:__
	* [Khan Academy uses JavaScript/Process.js to teach computer science](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/programming/variables/p/challenge-bucktooth-bunny)
	* [Creative programming, user interface experimentation (hakim.se)](http://hakim.se/experiments)
	* [Skifree.js!](http://basicallydan.github.io/skifree.js/)

\* (we're going to start off a little less ambitious, though)

<section markdown="block">
## A Quick Rundown of its Features

* __multi paradigm__ - __Object Oriented__ (through prototypes), __Functional__, etc.
* __dynamically typed__ (eh... maybe not a great feature?)
* __weakly typed__ (also maybe not a great feature?)
* most implementations are __interpreted__ rather than compiled (or at least hide the compilation from you ... shrug)
* __C-like syntax__ - so you should be pretty familiar with all of the curly braces
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## It's Available!

* you can install server-side JavaScript on multiple platforms (Node.js has __Windows__, __Linux__, and __OSX__ installers)
* it's available on every major browser (such as Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer)
* not only are you able to run JavaScript, but... if you have a web browser and a text editor, you will be able to write JavaScript programs as well!
* __check out the JavaScript _console_ in Chrome__ &rarr;
* In Chrome: View &rarr; Developer &rarr; JavaScript Console
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Running JavaScript

We'll be running JavaScript on both the server and the client... so we'll rely on:

* {:.fragment} the __Node.js__ commandline interpreter / [REPL](http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html), which is really just [V8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) (what's v8? &rarr;)
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
node myfile.js
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
pines:~ joe$ node
> console.log('REPL time!')
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}
* {:.fragment} and Chrome for running JavaScript in browser (which is, coincidentally, also __v8__)

## For the first few classes, it would be good to use __node__, but your browser's developer tools or jsfiddle will work in a pinch.

## A few Notes on How You'll be Writing Programs

* use any text editor you want (I don't care, really)
* some editors that I, as well as other students, have used in the past:
    * Visual Studio Code (&larr; this one is pretty good!)
    * Atom
	* sublimetext
	* WebStorm
	* vim (&lt;-- I use this mostly, but _probably not a good choice if you don't already know it_)
* if you don't have node installed yet, you could use
	* your browser's developer tools (ugh?)
	* [jsfiddle](jsfiddle.net) (or [codepen](codepoen.io) or jsbin, etc.)

## Let's End With a Quick Survey

I'd like to get an idea of what languages / technologies everyone has had experience with. 

* __please fill out__ [this survey]({{ site.survey_intro }}) rn 
* take ~5 minutes to do this in class (you can finish it up outside of class later)
* (it's also my secret way of taking attendance)
* (and collecting your GitHub usernames)
