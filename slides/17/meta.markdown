## Nodemon

Use __nodemon__ to automatically restart your server whenever file changes occur:

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
# install it
npm install -g nodemon
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
# run your project calling nodemon... and the executable for your project
nodemon bin/www
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
# sometimes you have to specify the exact extensions to monitor
nodemon bin/www -e "js hbs css html"
</code></pre>

## Homework

Homework #6 is posted:

* it's about creating grocery lists
* __let's check it out__ &rarr;
* ... authentication is extra credit
	* because it's a bit lengthy and covers a few more topics that we haven't gotten a chance to go over
	* and I wanted to assign a take-from-home quiz (finally)

## Quiz

Since we're easing out of server side development, I want to make sure everyone's caught up with HTML/CSS. I've put gathered some tutorials / articles in case you need a refresher.
