## Validation Recap

__Where does validation of user-inputted data occur in the technology stack that we're using? In the datbase? The application?__ &rarr;

In our technology stack, validation occurs in the application layer - both on the client side and on the server side.
{:.fragment}

__Should validation occur on the client, server, or both?__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* minimally, it should be done on the server side since requests can originate from clients that aren't browsers
* ideally, validation would be done on both the server and client side
{:.fragment}

<br>

__Where in our application have we done validation so far?__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* in the mongoose Schema
* on the client side through form elements
{:.fragment}

<br>

__Let's review some validation.__ &rarr; ...  __And... let's go back and check out other places where we can place validation.__ &rarr;
